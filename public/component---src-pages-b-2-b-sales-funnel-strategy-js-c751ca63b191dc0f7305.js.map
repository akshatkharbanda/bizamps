Sounds like an awesome dream right? But, genuine buyers who do not waste your time are hard to find.</p>\n                <p>But if you plan to do that for your B2B agency, the cost per click for such ads can be as high as $35! That is equivalent to buying 35 lottery tickets! And let’s face it; they both have the same odds.</p>\n                <p>So is there a way to do it for cheap?</p>\n                <p>The answer to this is BOFU content- Bottom of the Funnel content. This refers to the content that only resonates with your target audience. This way the content created is less but a perfect fit for the target. It is basically created for people who want many people to read their content but attract only the qualified leads. </p>\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n\n                <p><b>41% of B2B marketers say they always or frequently craft content based on specific points\n                of the buyer’s journey (source).</b></p>\n                <p>That means more than half of the B2B sales agencies do not curate BOFU content.</p>\n\n                <p>Before understanding BOFU content, let me ask you a question.\n                 How many times have you filled a form after reading a blog? -Hardly once or twice after reading<br></br>\n                a really great piece of content, right? </p>\n                <p>That brings me to my next question.<br></br>\n                What do you search for when you go out to buy something?</p>\n                <p>Before making a fairly huge investment, we are overly cautious.</p>\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n\n                <p><b>92% of buyers say that content plays an important role in their buying decision.</b></p>\n                <p>But there is also a bad news. 1 in 2 buyers report that they usually receive content irrelevant to their pain point. So at which stage does content development comes into play?</p>\n                <p>Let’s say you are planning to buy a new phone.\n                These are the steps any normal person would follow</p>\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n\n                <p><b>1. Research</b></p>\n                <p>Before buying a new phone you would first research the features it has. The processor, the\n                camera quality, the battery life, and so on.</p>\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n\n                <p><b>2. Reviews</b></p>\n                <p>After learning about the features you will go on and look at the reviews as the word of mouth affects the buying decision the most.</p>\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n\n                <p><b>3. Pricing</b></p>\n                <p>Next, you’ll research about the pricing, the offers, and discounts available.</p>\n                <br></br>\n                <br></br>\n\n                <p><b>4. Alternatives</b></p>\n                <p>Lastly, you’ll look for alternatives.
