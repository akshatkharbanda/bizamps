Channel and Cadence. </p>\n                  <br></br>\n\n                  <p style={{fontFamily:\"Roboto\"}}><b>Channel</b></p>\n                  <p>In my 3 years’ experience, I’ve noticed that some channels work better than others.</p>\n                  <p>Example: </p>\n                  <p>· LinkedIn works best when one wants to approach angel investors. </p>\n                  <p>· Calling works when the target is not tech-savvy.</p>\n                  <p>· Direct mail works when you want to stand out.  </p>\n                  <p>When you start using all these channels, there’ll come a point where you’ll know the channel that is working the best for you. When you do, don’t stop using other channels, but scale the one that works the best. </p>\n                  <p style={{fontFamily:\"Roboto\"}}><b>Cadence</b></p> \n                  <p>Don’t just send one message. Even though sometimes it works, you should send multiple messages with various time intervals.</p>\n                  <p>One way is to send 1 message in 7 days. </p>\n                  <br></br>\n                  <br></br>\n\n                  <p style={{fontFamily:\"Roboto\",fontSize:\"2rem\" }}><b>2. Offering</b></p>\n                  <p>The offerings matter.</p>  \n                  <p>Firstly, if the product has a need in the current situation then the leads will hit the sky. </p>\n                  <p>Example: In the Covid-19 pandemic, the sale of sanitizers spiked.</p> \n                  <p>Secondly, different people find value in different offerings. So filter your audience accordingly </p>\n                  <br></br>\n                  <br></br>\n\n                  <p style={{fontFamily:\"Roboto\",fontSize:\"2rem\" }}><b>3. Messaging</b></p>\n                  <p>Messaging is very important. It can either make or break your campaign.</p> \n                  <p>While hiring people, try looking for someone who has done such work before. There is a high possibility that you won’t find such a person. No one really knows what could work for sure. </p> \n                  <p>So be prepared to conduct A/B testing yourself. A/B testing your subject line can increase open rates by 49%. </p>\n                  <p>Also, pay attention to the details and test everything. </p>\n                  <br></br>\n                  <br></br>\n\n                  <p style={{fontFamily:\"Roboto\",fontSize:\"2rem\" }}><b>4. Scaling and Debugging </b></p>\n                  <p>When you figure something out, scale it.</p> \n                  <p>When you try to multiply, you are bound to face certain barriers like your account getting limited or getting banned. Don’t worry here, it’s a small thing. Create another account and continue your work at the same speed. </p>\n                  <p>Sometimes your mails might end up in the spam folder. Look for tools and figure out a way through which the emails can last longer.</p> \n                  <p>Later in the blog, I’ll explain the techniques to scale. </p>\n                  <p>Let’s dive into these points even deeper </p>\n                  <br></br>\n                  <br></br>\n\n                  <p style={{fontFamily:\"Roboto\"}}><b>1. Email </b></p>\n                  <p>One thing to keep in mind while conducting email outreach is that your email must be of 5 lines, preferably under 100 words. If the person has to scroll down, it won’t be read.  </p>\n                  <p>Keep it simple. Use plain text. </p>\n                  <p>Keep yourself updated with the latest tricks. </p>\n                  <p>One word subject lines like ‘ leads’, ‘BizAmps’, and so on, using “Hey XYZ” instead of “Hi XYZ” are some of the latest tricks that increase response rate by 10-12% provided your initial response rate is over 0%.</p> \n                  <p>One important thing to note here is to not be misleading in any way. Misleading reduces the credibility of your future emails. </p>\n                  <br></br>\n                  <br></br>\n\n                  <p style={{fontFamily:\"Roboto\",fontSize:\"2rem\",fontWeight:\"600\" }}>FUN FACTS ABOUT COLD EMAILS: </p>\n                  <p>· 35% of recipients open emails based on the subject line alone.</p> \n                  <p>· Email personalization can increase your reply rate by 100%.</p>\n                  <br></br>\n                  <br></br>\n\n                  <p style={{fontFamily:\"Roboto\"}}><b>2. LinkedIn</b></p>\n                  <p>Keep your text under 2 lines and 2 paragraphs.</p>\n                  <p>Linked in has various features that you need to understand and use correctly, for instance, the ‘Inmail’ has a greater space than the free messages window and thus, both should be used accordingly.</p>\n                  <p>Here, a proper understanding of LinkedIn’s UX comes handy.</p>\n                  <p>LinkedIn has your CV, your picture, and more relevant information about you than any other platform. You can capitalize on that, making your account more relevant.</p>\n                  <p>Lastly, know your limits. Don’t sound too sales-y. Refrain from spamming people with irrelevant information.</p>\n                  <p>The biggest mistake a marketer can make is underestimate the potential of LinkedIn.</p>\n                  <br></br>\n                  <br></br>\n\n                  <p style={{fontFamily:\"Roboto\",fontSize:\"2rem\",fontWeight:\"600\" }}>FUN FACT ABOUT LINKED:</p>\n                  <p> · 57% of LinkedIn users are men, and 43% are women.</p> \n                  <p>· 61% of LinkedIn’s users are between 25 and 34 years old</p>\n                  <br></br>\n                  <br></br>\n\n                  <p style={{fontFamily:\"Roboto\"}}><b>3.

Listen to it later and write down a few hooks that you think the client resonates with and stress on those things when following up.</p>\n                  <p>You can also write down new hooks and use it as a script.</p>\n                  <p>However, calling has its own limitations.</p>\n                  <br></br>\n                  <br></br>\n\n                  <p style={{fontFamily:\"Roboto\",fontSize:\"2rem\",fontWeight:\"600\"}}>FUN FACTS ABOUT COLD CALLING:</p>\n                  <p>· The best time to make a cold call is in the afternoon between 4:00-5:00pm. The second best time is 8:00-10:00am.</p>\n                  <p>· The first 10 seconds determine the response to your cold call. Make those 10 seconds count.</p> \n                  <br></br>\n                  <p>These 3 channels when used together for 3-6 months can result in getting responses from prospects. Be persistent.</p>\n                  <p>Another thing that I learned in this 3-year experience is that a change in the message that earlier gave negative responses gives positive responses.</p>\n                  <p>A while ago I decided to change the headline of the content we were working on.
